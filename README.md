# Introduction to Software Engineering
## CSIS 602
### I know, I know.... this is literally our job title...

### The Tree Structure 
So as of right meow, I've organized the class materials into this tree structure:
```bash

poe@PowersOfEight: ~/CSIS602 $ tree .                                                                                                               master 
.
├── README.md
└── Weeks
    └── 1
        └── class-notes.md

3 directories, 2 files

```


As you can see, we've got the weeks with `class-notes`, and we'll put in todos to organize/track our progress.
